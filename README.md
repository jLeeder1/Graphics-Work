# Graphics-Work
My OpenGL graphics lab and coursework

The class of my own work is "shapes.java".

This coursework was about using the basics of openGL to create a graphical piece with the theme of video game interface.

My game interface was a simple jumping game in which the character would play as a sheep that needed to jump over an incoming fence

In this work the graphical concepts used are:

-Transformations (Translating, Scaling and Rotating)

-Applying textures

-Manipulating lighting (Ambient, Diffusion, Specular)

-Creating a complex object

-Manipulating simple objects (like cubes)

-Simple annimations

-Complex animation (having many objects move at once, in this case all of the objects of the sheep moving forward as well as the legs going up and down to simulate running)
